# Book-A-Bite
 
Welcome to our restaurant reservation application for Software Development 4155!

### Possible Technologies
- Node.js for server-side javascript (industry standard)
- Express.js for RESTful API to perform CRUD operations
- PostgreSQL for backend storage
- React.js frontend

### Tips
- In directory you will see Frontend and Backend folders
- In frontend: React app
- In backend: node and express app
- Will need to open each in vscode seperately and run on their own terminals
